    "# NAIP and CHM Spatial Alignment Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook performs spatial alignment and resampling between NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) aerial imagery and CHM (Canopy Height Model) data to ensure consistent spatial registration for integrated analysis. The workflow handles potential misalignments in extent, resolution, and pixel registration that can occur between different data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose and Application\n",
    "While current classification workflows use NAIP and CHM independently (NAIP for bare earth analysis, CHM for vegetation assessment), this alignment process prepares the data for future integrated analyses that may require both datasets to be spatially synchronized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "The alignment process includes:\n",
    "1. **Spatial Extent Analysis**: Compare bounding boxes of NAIP and CHM datasets\n",
    "2. **Resolution Harmonization**: Identify the finer resolution and set as target\n",
    "3. **Overlap Calculation**: Determine the intersecting spatial area\n",
    "4. **Resampling and Clipping**: Align both datasets to common extent and resolution\n",
    "5. **Meadow Boundary Clipping**: Extract data within the study area boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use This Notebook\n",
    "- **Required**: When NAIP and CHM have different pixel sizes or extents\n",
    "- **Optional**: When datasets are already well-aligned spatially\n",
    "- **Future-proofing**: To prepare data for potential multi-sensor analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Requirements\n",
    "- NAIP imagery file (`naip_{site}.tif`)\n",
    "- Canopy Height Model (`chm_{site}.tif`)\n",
    "- Meadow boundary polygon (`meadow_extent.geojson`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Products\n",
    "- Spatially aligned NAIP and CHM rasters\n",
    "- Consistent pixel registration and extent\n",
    "- Common coordinate reference system\n",

    "## Background and Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses spatial alignment between NAIP imagery and CHM (Canopy Height Model) data. The alignment process may be needed if:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NAIP extent is not exact**: Slight differences in spatial boundaries\n",
    "- **Different pixel sizes**: NAIP and CHM have different spatial resolutions  \n",
    "- **Registration issues**: Minor geometric misalignments between datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Workflow Status\n",
    "The existing classification workflows operate independently:\n",
    "- **NAIP**: Used for bare earth percent cover analysis\n",
    "- **CHM**: Used for vegetation cover assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Applications\n",
    "This alignment prepares data for potential integrated analyses that require both datasets to be spatially synchronized. Running this notebook ensures data compatibility for future multi-sensor approaches."
